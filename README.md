Heartbleeding bug test website
==================================================


I have forked some of the projects and scripts which were available online and stitched them together to create a website which makes testing heartbleed bug easier. The parents of this application are:

* Original heartbleed test: https://gist.github.com/sh1n0b1/10100394

* Javascript sandbox: https://github.com/josscrowcroft/javascript-sandbox-console

* Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/#a-minimal-application

==================================================

The application in action: http://heartbleeding.herokuapp.com/
